# Hotel Review App
This is a sample hotel review app boilerplate. This repository is setup for anyone to show us your skills in AngularJS, Javascript and mobile development.

### Basic Requirements
1. Show hotels in nearby location
2. Show the reviews of each hotel (Please find a open source API to get the reviews)
3. Photo gallery of each hotel
4. Make sure this app is able to run on iOS and Android simulator

The rest is up to you to think and innovate.
Fork a copy of this to your own repository and [email](mailto:liakwee.lee@mirumagency.com) us your forked link when you're done, DO NOT work directly here.
